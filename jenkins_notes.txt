 An artifact is a file produced as a result of a Jenkins build
1)   If an artifact is archived, it is copied to the workspace of the buildâ€™s job on the Jenkins Master
2)   An archived file is kept in ${JENKINS_HOME} forever unless it is explicitly deletedB  
3)   GUI listing on http://<JENKINS_URL>/asynchPeople/
4)   DB is stored in XML files located in ${JENKINS_HOME}/users
5)   Credentials to connect different envirnoment like git,sonarqube,jfrog  are encrypted using a key derived from the master key
6)  This is stored as a secret so it cannot be deserialized to disk as plain text

7) Notifications are posted to the jenkinsci-advisories Google group 
We recommend that you subscribe to this group to receive timely notifications
 8 ) The agent is the tool that manages the executors on a remote node, on behalf of Jenkins.
9 )A node is taken offline if disk space,swapmemory,timesysnc  cross the configured threshold.
10) Agents small Java client processes that connect to a Jenkins Master over the Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP)
11) Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor is a graphical editor that allows you
to easily create a Declarative Pipeline.
13) Jenkins sets its own specific environment variables (such as BUILD_NUMBER, NODE_NAME and JOB_NAME)
 
14)plugin extension  with an hpi or jpi .
jenkins permession:
Administer - Make system-wide configuration changes

Perform highly sensitive operations that amount to full local system access (within the scope granted by the underlying operating system)

In versions 5.25 (November 2018) and later, Overall/Administrator does not imply the Overall/RunScripts, Overall/UploadPlugins, and Overall/Configure UpdateCenter permissions

Read - View almost all pages within Jenkins

RunScripts - Run Groovy scripts using the Groovy console or Groovy CLI command

UploadPlugins - Upload arbitrary plugins

Can execute arbitrary code in the context of any Jenkins internal user

ConfigureUpdateCenter - Configure update sites and proxy settings

Can control the update site metadata and plugin files downloaded y the Jenkins plugin manager

Can be used to execute arbitrary code

MORE ABOUT OVERALL/RUNSCRIPTS
Users with Overall/RunScripts permissions can use the Script Console to run a Groovy script in the Groovy Sandbox without getting administrator approval

Is useful for troubleshooting and diagnostics

Each method call, object construction, and field access is checked against a whitelist of approved operations

If the script attempts to use an unapproved operation, it is killed

The unapproved operation is added to an approval queue which an administrator can review and, if appropriate, can add the operation to the whitelist

CAVEATS FOR OVERALL/RUNSCRIPTS PERMISSIONS
Users with the "Overall/RunsScripts" permission can execute arbitrary code in the context of any Jenkins internal user, including the internal SYSTEM user

Jenkins Script Console includes valuable security guidelines
